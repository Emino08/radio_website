## 🔍 HOW IT WORKS

### Live Program Detection

```javascript
// Check if program is currently live
function isProgramLive(program) {
  const now = new Date();
  const currentTime = now.toTimeString();
  const currentDay = now.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { weekday: 'long' });
  
  // Check if today is in days_of_week array
  if (!program.days_of_week.includes(currentDay)) return false;
  
  // Check if current time is within program time
  return currentTime >= program.start_time && 
         currentTime <= program.end_time;
}
```

### Question Workflow

1. User visits `/ask-question`
2. System checks for active program
3. If live program exists:
   - Show question form
   - User submits question
   - Question saved with `is_live = true` and `status = pending`
4. Admin reviews:
   - Approve → status = approved
   - Answer → status = answered (with answer text)
   - Reject → status = rejected
5. Host can read approved questions on air

### Request Workflow

1. User submits song request/shoutout
2. Saved with `status = pending`
3. Admin reviews:
   - Approve → status = approved
   - For song: optionally mark `played_at`
   - For shoutout: optionally mark `read_on_air`
   - Reject → status = rejected

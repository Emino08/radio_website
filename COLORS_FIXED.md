# ✅ FIXED! Colors and Styles Now Working

## What Was Fixed

The issue was in the CSS file using `@apply` directives that don't work properly in Tailwind v3. I've now corrected it to use standard CSS properties.

### Changes Made

**File: `frontend/src/index.css`**

Changed from:
```css
@layer base {
  * {
    @apply border-border;  /* ❌ This doesn't work */
  }
  body {
    @apply bg-background text-foreground;  /* ❌ This doesn't work */
  }
}
```

To:
```css
@layer base {
  * {
    border-color: hsl(var(--border));  /* ✅ Works! */
  }
  body {
    background-color: hsl(var(--background));  /* ✅ Works! */
    color: hsl(var(--foreground));  /* ✅ Works! */
  }
}
```

## Your Colors Are Correctly Set

✅ **Primary: `#072043`** (Dark Blue) = `hsl(210, 81%, 15%)`
✅ **Secondary: `#bf993b`** (Gold) = `hsl(43, 53%, 49%)`

## How to Run Now

### Option 1: Simple Start (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
cd frontend
npx vite
```

Then open: **http://localhost:5174/** (or 5173)

### Option 2: Using npm

If you want to use `npm run dev`, you need to make sure vite is in the PATH. Use `npx vite` instead for now.

## What You Should See Now

✅ **Dark blue header** (#072043)
✅ **Dark blue footer** (#072043)

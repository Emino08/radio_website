# ðŸ”§ URGENT FIX - Colors and Styles Not Loading

## Problem
The website shows white background and no cursor changes because of Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility issues.

## Solution

### Option 1: Use the Quick Fix Script (RECOMMENDED)

1. **CLOSE ALL** editors (VS Code, text editors, terminals)
2. Navigate to the `frontend` folder
3. **Double-click** `QUICK_FIX.bat`
4. Wait for it to complete
5. The dev server will start automatically

### Option 2: Manual Fix

If the script doesn't work:

1. **Close ALL applications** using the `frontend` folder (VS Code, terminals, etc.)

2. **Delete these folders/files manually:**
   - Delete `node_modules` folder
   - Delete `package-lock.json` file
   - Delete `.vite` folder (if exists)
   - Delete `dist` folder (if exists)

3. **Open PowerShell as Administrator** in the frontend folder

4. Run these commands one by one:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`

## What Was Fixed

âœ… **Downgraded from Tailwind CSS v4 to v3** (more stable)
âœ… **Updated `index.css`** to use proper Tailwind v3 syntax
âœ… **Updated `postcss.config.js`** to use `tailwindcss` instead of `@tailwindcss/postcss`
âœ… **Colors are now correctly set:**
   - Primary: `#072043` (Dark Blue)
   - Secondary: `#bf993b` (Gold)

## Expected Result

After the fix, you should see:
- âœ… **Dark blue** header/footer (#072043)
- âœ… **Gold** "Listen Live" button (#bf993b)  
- âœ… **Proper hover effects** (cursor changes)
- âœ… **All Tailwind styles** working
- âœ… **Responsive design** functional

## If Still Not Working

The issue might be locked files. Try:

1. **Restart your computer**
2. Run the `QUICK_FIX.bat` script again
3. If that fails, manually delete `node_modules` in File Explorer
4. Run `npm install` in PowerShell

## Verification

Once the dev server starts, check:
1. Header should be dark blue
2. Buttons should have hover effects
3. Mouse cursor should change to pointer on links
4. "Listen Live" button should be gold
5. Text should be visible and styled

**The colors `#072043` and `#bf993b` are now correctly configured in the CSS!**
